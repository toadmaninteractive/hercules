## Hercules For Game DesignersÔÉÅ

- Universal data editor that works with all kinds of game design data
- Lightweight design cycle without technical routines: launching heavy engine editors, submitting changes to version control systems, making builds, performing installations, waiting for playtests to start, and receiving feedback
- On-the-fly design changes in single-player and multiplayer sessions
- Game backend server may be permitted to access documents
- Documents are similar to prefabs in Unity and blueprints in Unreal Engine
- Document categories define the different design objects in the game (characters, items, abilities, weapons, etc.)
- Ideal for rule-based games, data-driven designs, and massive multiplayer sessions yet less suitable for scripted and story-based games
- Compared to Unreal Engine 4 blueprint binary formats, JSON-based documents permit collaboration among multiple users
- Encourages creative user input with a possibility to experiment with game design in practice
